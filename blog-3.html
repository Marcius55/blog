    <h1>The Challenges of Immigrant Life at Belgium’s Fedasil Centers</h1>

      <h2>Ongoing Struggles for Basic Needs</h2>
      <img src="/images/challenges-img-2.png" alt="Emmanuel's tent near Fedasil center" class="article-img" />
      <p>In recent years, Europe has faced major immigration challenges — and Belgium is no exception. The Belgian federal asylum agency, <strong>Fedasil</strong>, has had to shut down several overcrowded shelters, leaving many immigrants stranded and uncertain about their futures.</p>
      <p><strong>Emmanuel</strong>, a 34-year-old asylum seeker from Botswana, has lived in a tent for four months. “Yes, it's very difficult to be here all alone without family,” he says. “Sometimes I feel like I don’t matter at all just because I’m a man.” Despite the hardship, he remains hopeful.</p>

      <h2>Long Waits and Uncertain Futures</h2>
      <img src="/images/challenges-img-3.png" alt="Omar waiting for assistance" class="article-img" />
      <p>Due to long administrative delays, many people wait in temporary shelters for months — even years — without knowing when they'll be placed or reunited with loved ones. <strong>Omar</strong>, from South Africa, lives in a tent while his family is already in Bruges.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “The waiting process is stressful, and the fact that I don’t know how long I’ll be in this situation keeps me anxious all the time...”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Police regularly search for tents and remove them, increasing tension and instability for those in hiding. “I often have to run away at night,” Omar adds. “If they find my tent, they’ll take it away — with everything in it.”</p>

      <h2>Living Conditions & Community Efforts</h2>
      <img src="/images/challenges-img-4.png" alt="Campsite near Fedasil building" class="article-img" />
      <p>Fedasil provides basic needs such as food and medical help, but the system is overwhelmed. Volunteer groups try to fill the gaps by offering hot drinks, food parcels, and emotional support — but they’re stretched thin.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “We are here to help, but it’s more complicated than it seems.” — Fedasil volunteer
      </blockquote>
      <p>With Brussels being the only registration hub, many travel from other cities and wait in tents for days. The system is overloaded, and volunteers themselves admit: “There’s no easy way in situations like this.”</p>

      <h2>Political Shift & Policy Impact</h2>
      <img src="/images/challenge-img-5.png" alt="Immigrants waiting outside Fedasil building" class="article-img" />
      <p>Belgium’s new conservative-led government has tightened immigration policies — reducing asylum quotas and cutting support services. These changes have increased uncertainty for people who are already vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Fedasil’s funding has been reduced, forcing more center closures and increasing pressure on volunteers and remaining facilities. While the government says it’s trying to help, the gap between policy and reality is growing.</p>

    <section class="message">
      <h2>A Call for Change</h2>
      <p>The system is visibly under strain. Like many European nations, Belgium is caught between resource limits and the need to uphold human rights.</p>
      <p><strong>People like Emmanuel and Omar represent thousands in limbo.</strong> They wait weeks and months — hoping for a new beginning. But for many, that future seems increasingly out of reach.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “We need change more than ever before. People just want to live a normal life.” — A volunteer
