    <h1>Digital Age: Social Media Impact for Society</h1>

      <h2>Introduction to the Digital Era</h2>
      <img src="/images/media-img.webp" alt="Various social media icons" class="article-img" />
      <p>Since its launch in 2006, Facebook — originally created by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg — helped kick off an era that has come to define how we communicate and interact. Though platforms like MySpace existed as early as 1997, the explosion of apps like Twitter (X), Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube has reshaped daily life. As of now, 4.8 billion people worldwide use social media — nearly 60% of the global population.</p>
      <p>But is it all for the better? While some embrace this connectivity, others raise serious concerns about mental health, attention spans, and the erosion of offline social life.</p>

      <h2>What Keeps Us Hooked?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Likes, shares, and alerts are designed to keep you coming back — just like a slot machine.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Smartphones have made social media accessible at all times, increasing the risk of overuse. Notifications can interrupt sleep, hinder focus, and create psychological dependence. Social platforms are intentionally engineered to maximize user engagement — often exploiting the brain’s reward system by triggering dopamine responses, much like gambling or sugar consumption.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>The Downsides of Digital Life</h2>
      <p>According to University of Michigan research, around 210 million people worldwide are addicted to social media. Despite the intent to connect people, overuse can increase loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Without meaningful face-to-face interactions, we miss out on essential emotional hormones that reduce stress and build optimism.</p>
      <p>Cyberbullying and self-esteem issues are also common side effects. Recognizing when usage becomes harmful is crucial to maintaining mental balance.</p>

      <h2>Silver Linings: The Benefits of Social Media</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Despite its flaws, social media connects, educates, and inspires.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s not all bad. Social media can strengthen bonds between people, provide fast access to global news, and serve as a hub for educational content. Many users find inspiration, ideas, and guidance on platforms tailored to their interests. With responsible use, these tools can be positive forces for connection and learning.</p>

      <h2>Finding the Balance</h2>
      <p>Social media is a double-edged sword. It can distract and isolate — but also connect and educate. Understanding how to use these platforms consciously, with limits and purpose, is key to thriving in the digital world.</p>
      <p>By selecting the right sources, limiting screen time, and prioritizing real-world relationships, we can reduce the risks while keeping the benefits. The choice — and the balance — is ours to strike.</p>
