    <h2>Discovering Mechelen's Spiritual Landscape</h2>
    <p>Mechelen, a city in Flanders, Belgium, is home to a treasury of historical churches, with Saint Rumbold’s Cathedral standing as a testament to Mechelen's spiritual heritage in the heart of the city center. Father Philippe Hacour, the parish priest since September 2022, warmly welcomed me into Mechelen's spiritual tapestry and had an interesting discussion about the Mechelen Cathedral's spiritual life.</p>
    <p>Saint Rumbold's Cathedral, with its distinctive tower, holds a commanding presence in Mechelen's skyline. Father Philippe pointed into its unique charm, stating, "I think the iconic for this cathedral is the tower. It's quite a tall tower. It's also unfinished." The unfinished iconic tower that stands as a reference point for Mechelen's people and visitors makes the building unique.</p>
    <blockquote>“Catholic means, it's a Greek word, Catholic, and when you translate it, it means - universal,”</blockquote>
    <p>Hacour underlines the evolving Mechelen's faith community in the city's international character, emphasizing the universal nature of the Catholic Church reflected in Mechelen diverse in church. He sheds light on the changing composition, acknowledging the presence of people from different parts of the world within the faith community.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Community Vision</h2>
    <p>Father Philippe also addressed the challenges faced by the cathedral's community. "I'm searching for a good place near the cathedral where we can meet after Mass. A place for people to connect, share a cup of tea, and grow as a community," he shares, revealing his vision to create a welcoming space for community building after religious services to share each other's stories and life experience.</p>
    <blockquote>“What I desire is that people should sing more, so that would be nice if we all sing together. The mass should be really a celebration, a feast, a joy.”</blockquote>
    <p>He envisions the importance of collective participation in creating a joyous liturgical experience in the mass. "Imagine 100 people singing together. That you really feel it's a celebration. The mass should be really a celebration, a feast, a joy." He said inspiringly.</p>

    <h2>Christmas at the Cathedral</h2>
    <p>Father Philippe accepted that Christmas time and atmosphere are the most important celebrations in Saint Rumbold's Cathedral. He recounts special events, stating, "It was a strong liturgy, and then the day of Christmas on the twenty-fifth, it was the archbishop who celebrated mass even to midnight," capturing the unique charm of Saint Rumbold's Cathedral during the holiday season.</p>
    <p>He provides a detailed narrative of the extended opening hours, Christmas carols, and tailored celebrations for families, offering readers a vivid picture of the cathedral's Christmas festivities.</p>

    <h2>Faith in a Secular World</h2>
    <p>Navigating through the historical and religious fabric of Mechelen, Father Philippe reflects on the changing landscape of faith due to secularization. "Nowadays it still has some kind of importance, but for a lot of people, as you probably know, secularization is immense," he notes, acknowledging the shrinking ranks of the faithful religious people in Mechelen.</p>
    <p>He's trying to deepen Mechelen's role in shaping its citizens' spirituality over the years. However, he's hoping to expect more young families into the Cathedral mass.</p>

    <h2>A Message of Hope and Peace: Father Philippe's Final Thoughts</h2>
    <blockquote>“I also hope that people can grow in faith. They can encounter the risen Lord Jesus because he really matters. He can really change life.”</blockquote>
    <p>In a heartfelt conclusion, Father Philippe shares his wish for people to grow in openness, respect, and faith. He expresses a universal message of hope for the coming year.</p>
    <p>Father Philippe Hacour invites readers to embrace Mechelen's spiritual tapestry, providing a profound exploration of the harmonious blend of faith, heritage, and community within the sacred walls of Saint Rumbold's Cathedral. From the iconic tower to the challenges and aspirations of the faith community, this interview offers an in-depth perspective on Mechelen's spiritual journey, encapsulating the essence of Saint Rumbold’s Cathedral and its role in shaping the city's spiritual identity.</p>
