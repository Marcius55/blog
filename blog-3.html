    <h2>The Reality of Immigration in Belgium</h2>
    <p>In the last few years, Europe has faced big challenges in managing mass immigration and asylum seekers looking for protection and a better future — including Belgium.</p>
    <p>The Belgian federal asylum agency — <strong>Fedasil</strong> — has been obliged to close several of its already overcrowded facilities. This has left many immigrants in limbo, with worsening circumstances and increased anxiety about their future.</p>

    <p>Emmanuel, a 34-year-old asylum seeker from Botswana, has been living in a tent for four months. "I live here in a tent," he says, frustration in his voice. As more asylum centers close, he has no more options.</p>
    <p>Many single men like him often find themselves at the bottom of the list for secure accommodation, as scarce rooms are prioritised for families with children.</p>
    <blockquote>“Yes, it's actually very difficult to be here all alone without family, you feel ignored. Sometimes I feel like I don’t matter at all just because I’m a man but I understand why they prioritise kids and families.”</blockquote>
    <p>Still, he maintains optimism, stating, “Despite that I’m waiting here for four months now I'm still hoping that everything will be fine.”</p>

    <h2>Long Wait and Uncertain Future</h2>

    <p>Due to the long process that can last for an unestimated amount of time, many have been waiting in temporary shelters for months</p>
      <blockquote>“I live here in a tent.” — Emmanuel, asylum seeker from Botswana</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Omar</strong>, a South African immigrant, has found the waiting very difficult and stressful because his family has settled in Bruges while he is still living under a tent.</p>
    <blockquote>“I'm staying here for a few months. The waiting process is annoying and it’s stressing me out and the fact that I don’t know for how long I will be in this situation keeps me anxious all the time...”</blockquote>
    <p>“The police keeps on looking for tents, I often have to run away from them. If they find any tent, they’ll take it away with everything they find in it. This keeps me anxious every night.”</p>
    <p>Tiring waiting processes in cold Belgian autumn, lots of miscommunications, language barriers, and the unknowns of the situation make people mad and disappointed. Walking among people, you can feel the negative atmosphere. It becomes even more difficult to help and feel safe when people around are angry.</p>

    <h2>Living Conditions</h2>

    <p>Fedasil offers food, medical care, and some social assistance, but the system is straining under the weight of demand. Tent camps have become the norm for individuals who are unable to acquire housing space, with many immigrants depending on volunteers and community organizations to provide necessities.</p>
    <p>However, as more centers close their doors, these groups are under pressure from increased demand and limited resources, making it difficult for them to provide help.</p>
    <p>Despite the EU’s open doors and opportunities for immigrants, people say that the system has mistakes and pitfalls. Even if things are moving forward in this topic, the process is still slower and more complicated than it seems.</p>
    <blockquote>“We are here to help these people as much as we can, but it’s more complicated and we have to be patient,” said one of the volunteers helping immigrants.</blockquote>
    <p>The Belgian government institutions are also sending volunteers to help people who are waiting in the line. Volunteers provide people coffee or tea every morning, give them disposable food parcels, and try to help immigrants answer their questions or complaints. However, even volunteers agree that there is no easy way in this kind of situation.</p>
    <blockquote>“In my opinion, one of the biggest issues is the fact that Brussels is the only Belgian city that has this place where immigrants and refugees can register themselves,” said one of the volunteers. “Many people have to come here from different cities and spend days living under tents till they get the chance to enter the building and register.”</blockquote>

    <h2>New Government, Tougher Immigration Policies</h2>

    </figure>
    <p>Following Belgium's recent elections, the new conservative-led government has taken a tougher position on immigration, intending to reduce the number of asylum applicants through new admission standards and lower support services.</p>
    <p>This transition has made the uncertainty and anxiety of immigrants and asylum seekers much worse, after already spending months in overcrowded institutions. Funding cuts to agencies such as Fedasil, who are already dealing with overcrowded shelters, are putting additional strain on resources, while the recent closure of certain centers has worsened the issue.</p>
    <p>Belgium faces challenging options as it attempts to balance the need to cater for newcomers with limited resources. Every day that passes without a clear solution leaves people like Emmanuel and Omar — and many others — waiting in a system with too many flaws to meet their needs.</p>
    <p>These people are giving their time, counting from days to months, spending their money to come to the place, and risking their future to become a part of Belgium. They remain optimistic to this day, but the people need change more than ever before to live a normal life in the EU territory.</p>
