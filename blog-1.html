      <h2>Jazz Music in Our Society</h2>
      <p>The sound of live jazz music emanating from Brussels bars and other European cities is becoming increasingly popular in modern times, despite the abundance of music streaming technologies. Bart De Nolf, head of the Jazz section at the Brussels Royal Academy, believes that people today feel more connected to music than ever before — yet the rise in live jazz audiences proves a renewed love for in-person performance.</p>

      <h2>Meet Bart De Nolf</h2>
      <img src="/images/jazz-img-2.png" class="bart-image" />
      <p>Bart is a double bassist who began his musical journey at 14, studying classically at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Gent. A key turning point came when he met John Clayton at a music camp — a meeting that sparked Bart’s deep connection with jazz. Since 1993, Bart has taught at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel, worked at the Taipei Summer Jazz Academy, and collaborated with jazz legends from Vaya Con Dios to Toots Thielemans.</p>

      <h2>Bart’s Connection With Jazz Music</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “When I was young, I wanted to quit music school… but then I heard my father’s jazz records and I felt something — I knew that’s what I wanted to do.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>After meeting John Clayton, an American jazz bassist, Bart was introduced to the deeper world of jazz. John taught him improvisation techniques and inspired him to keep playing. To this day, they remain close friends, with Bart even inviting him to perform in Belgium.</p>

      <h2>How Has Jazz Influenced His Life?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “I never really thought about it — jazz has always been like breathing to me.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Bart views jazz as a natural part of life. It has shaped not just his career, but his identity, emotions, and outlook on humanity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Origin of Jazz</h2>
      <p>Jazz originated in <strong>New Orleans</strong> during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city’s unique mix of cultures gave rise to gospel-rooted improvisation, especially among African-American communities. Bart emphasizes jazz’s power as both musical expression and social resistance:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Jazz was a form of resistance during hard times. It’s not about color — it’s about something everyone understands: music.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Bart’s Message</h2>
      <p>“A lot is happening in the world. We need to respect each other — especially the youth, because they are the future.”</p>
      <p><strong>“Music respects everyone and brings us together. We should be united like music.”</strong></p>
