    <h2>Jazz Music in Our Society</h2>
    <p>The sound of live jazz music emanating from Brussels bars and other European cities is becoming increasingly popular in modern times, despite the plethora of music listening technologies available to us. Bart De Nolf, head of the Jazz section at the Brussels Royal Academy, remarked that people nowadays have a deeper connection with music than ever before, thanks to the variety of music apps and technologies. Nevertheless, the growing number of visitors at live jazz music performances in Brussels and Antwerp bars indicates a resurgence of interest in live jazz music.</p>

    <h2>Bart’s Connection With Jazz Music</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “When I was young, I attended music school, and there was a time when I wanted to quit because it bothered me. My father had a great collection of jazz records. The first time I listened to these records, I felt deep inside — That's what I really want to do!”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Bart recalled, describing his initial passion for jazz music. “I knew that I wanted to play jazz; I just didn't know where to start.” Bart began immersing himself in the company of musicians, gaining experience and learning from them. Appearing to music camp for the first time Bart met the person who changed his life — John Clayton. The American jazz and classical music double bassist was invited to coach young students at the music camp. There John introduced Bart to the technique and intricacies of jazz music. Bart De Nolf still keeps in touch with John Clayton and invites him to perform in Belgium.</p>

    <h2>What Kind of Influence Does Jazz Music Have on Your Personal Life?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “I never really thought about it because jazz music seems like such a natural part of life to me, like breathing.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Bart said: “I listened to music a lot, and it has always been a part of my life.”</p>

    <h2>The Origin of Jazz Music</h2>
    <p>All indications and stories lead to one location where jazz likely originated — <strong>New Orleans</strong>, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city's blend of cultures was reflected in its music. Community events and the profound African-American experience played a significant role. It's no secret that African-American people, who began their musical journey with church gospels, are the originators of jazz music, which later evolved into the improvisational genre.</p>
    <blockquote>
      “During hard times, I believe jazz was also a form of expression and resistance against racism and social inequality.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Bart observed. “Jazz music allows full freedom of improvisation, and everyone can interpret it in their own way. It's not about skin color; it's about something we can all understand — music,” declared the head of the jazz section.</p>

    <h2>Bart’s Message</h2>
    <p>When asked what message he would send to the world, Bart replied, “Currently, a lot of things are happening in the world, and I think it's important to be respectful to each other, especially to young people because they're our future.”</p>
    <blockquote>“Music respects everyone and brings us together. We should be united like music.”</blockquote>
